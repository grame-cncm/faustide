# Testing Implementation – Step 08

Date: 2025-10-29

## Goal
Provide a concrete manual verification checklist to accompany automated coverage, ensuring audio, export, and UI workflows are validated before releases.

## Changes
- Added `docs/manual-testing.md` detailing hardware prerequisites and seven focused manual test suites (audio routing, recording, export, sharing, popup sync, responsive UX, browser-specific quirks).
- Linked the playbook from `docs/testing-strategy.md` so contributors can find it alongside automated coverage guidance.

## Validation
- Documentation-only update.
